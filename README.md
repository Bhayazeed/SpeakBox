## 💡 The Problem

Traditional online debates are **chaotic**. Comments get buried, conversations spiral into noise, and meaningful discourse gets lost in the clutter. Text-based platforms strip away the nuance of human voice—the passion, the hesitation, the conviction that makes arguments compelling.

## 🎯 The Solution

**SpeakBox** reimagines debate as a **spatial experience**. Instead of endless scrolling through text, participants navigate a visual canvas where each voice recording becomes a **node**—connected, organized, and alive.

Imagine walking into a room where ideas float in space. You can see how arguments connect, branch off, and respond to each other. Every voice is preserved, summarized by AI, and placed in its rightful context within the larger conversation.

## 🔮 How It Works

1. **Create or Join a Room** — Pick a topic like "Should AI be regulated?" or create your own debate space with a custom topic.

2. **Record Your Voice** — Instead of typing, speak your argument. Your voice carries weight that text simply cannot.

3. **AI-Powered Processing** — Gemini AI listens to your recording and extracts the key argument into concise bullet points. No transcription dumps—just the essence of what you said.

4. **Spatial Visualization** — Your contribution appears as a node on the canvas, connected to the argument you're responding to. Watch the debate grow organically as a visual tree of ideas.

5. **Content Moderation** — AI ensures discussions remain productive. Hate speech, harassment, and toxic content are filtered before they can poison the conversation.
